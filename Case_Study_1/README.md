## ðŸ“„ Case Study 1: Trade Settlement Process Optimization
### ðŸ”¹ Brief Summary
This project focused on reducing settlement failures in the trade lifecycle for global custody operationsâ€”particularly in DTC and Euroclear markets. As a Business Analyst, I collaborated with operations and technology teams to analyze trade data, identify process inefficiencies, and implement data-driven improvements.

I used tools like Excel, SQL, and JIRA to extract insights, propose automation alerts, document the existing process, and support UAT for system enhancements. This initiative led to smoother settlements and reduced operational risks.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal of the Project
To reduce trade settlement failure rates by at least 15% through:

Analyzing root causes of failures

Enhancing the escalation process

Proposing automation alerts for unmatched trades

Improving documentation and stakeholder coordination
