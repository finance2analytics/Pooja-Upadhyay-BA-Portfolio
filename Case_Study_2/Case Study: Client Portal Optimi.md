# Case Study: NEXEN Client Portal Optimization

## 📝 Project Title:
Improving Trade Visibility and Instruction Submission via NEXEN Client Portal

## 🧠 Project Background:
At ABC Company , clients used **Settlement Portal**, a proprietary web-based portal to:
- Monitor trade status
- Submit Receive/Delivery instructions
- Upload required documentation
- Access settlement and reconciliation reports

While widely used, the tool had some friction points reported by clients and internal servicing teams:
- **Delayed trade status updates**
- **Complex navigation for instruction entry**
- **Inconsistent reporting formats**

These issues often led to **increased inquiry volume**, missed deadlines, and instruction errors, impacting both client satisfaction and internal SLAs.

## 🎯 Project Goal:
To enhance the client experience and reduce errors by optimizing the **trade monitoring and instruction submission modules** of the NEXEN portal.

## 👩‍💼 My Role as Business Analyst:
Though I worked in operations, I closely collaborated with technology and product teams, contributing in the following areas:

### 🔹 Requirement Gathering:
- Collected feedback from client servicing and settlements teams
- Logged recurring client complaints and behavior patterns
- Conducted internal walkthroughs to identify UX issues

### 🔹 Process Analysis:
- Mapped AS-IS flow for instruction entry (manual steps, delays)
- Analyzed average time taken for submission and common error types

### 🔹 Documentation:
- Created a **mini-BRD** covering:
  - Need for real-time trade flag updates
  - Standardization of report formats
  - Redesign suggestions for UI forms (e.g., dropdowns for custodian, asset type)

### 🔹 Collaboration:
- Liaised with internal product teams via JIRA to raise enhancement requests
- Participated in **UAT** by validating new instruction forms and checking real-time updates in test environment
