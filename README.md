# Pooja Upadhyay â€“ Business Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Business Analyst portfolio! I bring 9+ years of experience in investment banking operations, with a focus on trade settlements and client servicing. I'm pivoting into a Business Analyst role, leveraging my domain expertise, strong documentation skills, and hands-on knowledge of tools like JIRA, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python.
